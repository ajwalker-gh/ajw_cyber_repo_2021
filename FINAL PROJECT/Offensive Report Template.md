This scan identifies the services below as potential points of entry:

- Target 1
```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE       REASON          VERSION
135/tcp  open  msrpc         syn-ack ttl 128 Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn   syn-ack ttl 128 Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds? syn-ack ttl 128
2179/tcp open  vmrdp?        syn-ack ttl 128
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server syn-ack ttl 128 Microsoft Terminal Services
```


The following vulnerabilities were identified on each target:

- Target 1
  - CVE-2008-5161 : SSH remote login was enabled at the user level with port 22 open.
  - CVE-2019-12215 : Full Path Disclosure
  - CVE-2019-15653 : HTML password disclosure â€“ The password was viewable 192.168.1.110/service.html)
  - CVE-2017-7760 : exposed username which enabled password brute force possibility

### Exploitation


The Red Team was able to penetrate `Target 1` and retrieve the following confidential data:

- Target 1
  - `flag1.txt`: {b9bbcb33e11b80be759c4e844862482d}
    - **Exploit Used**
      - User identified and access to system via SSH gained due to password being weak (same as login name). Search for first flag after access gained:
      - ``` $sh user@ip address ```
      - ``` $locate flag ```
      - ``` $cat www/var/html/service.html | grep 'flag' ```
      ![Flag1](images/flag1_grep.png)
  - `flag2.txt`: {fc3fd58dcdad9ab23faca6e9a36e581c}
    - **Exploit Used**
      - User password used to access system via SSH and flag2 found in Wordpress directory.
      - ``` $sh user@ip address ```
      - ``` $locate flag ```
      - ``` cat www/var/flag2.txt ```
      ![Flag2](images/flag2.png)
  - `flag3.txt`: {afc01ab56b50591e7dccf93122770cd2}
    - **Exploit Used**
      - Exploit of MySQL database using password found in ```wp-config.php``` located on exploited user account. Found in ```/var/www/html```
      ![Flag3](images/flag3.png)
  - `flag4.txt`: {715dea6c055b9fe3337544932f2941ce}
    - **Exploit Used**
      - User password hashes located in ```wp_users``` sql database and cracked using John The Ripper.
      - Access gained but privilege escalation required in order to search for flag. 
      - ```sudo -l``` used to determine available binaries - Python appeared to be available.
      - GTFOBins used to find and use command: ```$sudo python -c 'import os; os.system("/bin/sh")```
      - Root level access gained and search for flag4 lead to root directory location.
